        So a number of ago I saw an article about the Chicago DSA connected website found
        <a href="https://findmylandlord.chicagodsa.org/">Here</a>
        that talked about how landlords use multiple holding companies to obfuscate their property holdings.
        They went on to describe a methodology of matching that tax address to all others in a database to reveal
        these networks of holdings. I had recently learned Python and was curious if I would be able to do the same
        thing in Denver.

        Well I could and did, using Flask. I built a pretty simple single page site using the data available from the
        <a href="http://data.denvergov.org/">City of Denver Open Data Catalog</a> which is licensed under
        <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY 3.0</a>,
        and here are their <a href=https://www.denvergov.org/opendata/termsofuse"">Terms of Use</a> that I believe
            I'm now in complance with.

        I then geocoded all the locations,
        added the lat and long to the csv file and used open maps to plot the buildings locations.
        You would enter your address and if it was in the database it would grab the owner's address
        then cross-reference that to find all other properties that share that owner's address. I hosted it and moved on.
        But since then I've learned alot. Also, there have been huge developments in the real estate market and the
        old data just isn't correct in a lot of instances.

        This time I wrote a script that formats the xcel file into two JSONs. The map loads the first JSON that has all the addresses, their coordinates,
        the owner's address, and an ID number. When you click it sends an async request to the backend to use the owners address as a key to a dictionary
        that contains that owner's list of Dever properties. That dictionary is saved on the server as the second JSON file.
        Then that data loads in the Owned Properties section. The ID number is used to link each
        property in the list to it's marker on the map, so you can click through the owned properties and see their locations.
